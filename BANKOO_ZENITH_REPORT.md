# 🦞 BANKOO AI ZENITH: THE MASTER ARCHIVE (v18)

This document serves as the official record of the creation and evolution of Bankoo AI, the world's first **Neural Companion** with deep cultural integration and world-scale automation.

---

## 🏛️ 1. ARCHITECTURAL OVERVIEW
Bankoo (Project Moltbot) is a multi-modal AI system designed for extreme flexibility. It operates on a **Dual-Brain Logic** system.

### The Two Brains:
1.  **Zenith Cloud Brain**: Uses High-Reasoning LLMs (Llama 3.3, Gemini 2.0, DeepSeek) via Groq and OpenRouter for warp-speed intelligence.
2.  **Zenith Local Brain**: A private, offline engine powered by **Ollama**. It ensures Bankoo never "dies" even without internet.

## 🛠️ 2. THE TECH STACK
*   **Core Engine**: Python 3.12 (The absolute backbone).
*   **Intelligence Gateways**:
    *   **Groq**: Ultra-low latency inference.
    *   **OpenRouter**: Universal gateway to all major AI models.
    *   **Google Gemini**: Specialized massive-context processing.
*   **Voice Suite**:
    *   **Groq Whisper**: High-accuracy Speech-to-Text (STT).
    *   **ElevenLabs**: Premium Neural TTS with emotional "Gu-vibe" personas.
*   **Orchestration Layer**:
    *   **CrewAI**: Powers the "Agent Crews" for multi-agent collaboration.
    *   **Flask / JS**: The bridge between the Python brain and the Visual interface.

## 🚀 3. EVOLUTION MILESTONES (THE JOURNEY)

### [V12-V14] THE FOUNDATION
*   Established the basic chat loop.
*   Implemented **ElevenLabs Gujarati** support.
*   Built the first "Orb" interface.

### [V15-V16] THE HUB & AGENT FACTORY
*   **Skill Registry**: Created a modular system where skills can be plugged in.
*   **Agent Spawner**: Introduced the `/spawn` command, allowing Bankoo to birth "Mini-Agents" for specific tasks.

### [V17] INDEPENDENCE (LOCAL REVOLUTION)
*   Integrated **Ollama** for full local autonomy.
*   **Local Crew Engine**: Added the ability to run multi-agent crews entirely offline.
*   Introduced the **AETHER IDE**—a split-screen coding studio within the app.

### [V18] WORLD SKILLS (PRESENT DAY)
*   **Skill Hub Sync**: Integrated **1,705 community skills** from the OpenClaw repository.
*   **CLI Management**: Created `skill.bat` for automated repository synchronization.
*   **Recursive Indexing**: Bankoo now auto-registers every tool it finds in the `moltbot_skills` directory.

## 📂 4. CORE FILE SYSTEM
*   `assistant.py`: The Main Master Logic and Provider Router.
*   `api_hub.py`: The "Heart"—manages all external skills and registries.
*   `agent_factory.py`: The "Womb"—creates blueprints for new agents.
*   `crew_engine.py`: The "Orchestrator"—manages groups of agents working together.
*   `skill.bat` & `skill_downloader.py`: The "Sync Engine" for World Skills.
*   `bankoo_ui.html` & `index.css`: The Premium Visual Interface (The Glassmorphic Orb).

## 🦁 5. THE SPECIAL "BANKOO VIBE"
What makes your project unique compared to any other AI:
1.  **Cultural Intelligence**: Phonetic dictionaries that make the AI speak like a true friend in Gujarati and Bihari.
2.  **Scale**: Most assistants have 20-30 tools. Bankoo has **1,705**.
3.  **Speed**: Using Cerebras and Groq native lanes, Bankoo responds faster than typical human conversation.

---

## 🔮 6. THE FUTURE
*   **Vision Lab**: Real-time camera integration for seeing and reacting to the world.
*   **Global Memory**: Moving beyond JSON to a Vector Database for infinite long-term memory.
*   **True Autonomy**: Agents that can initiate tasks on their own based on scheduled cron-jobs.
